The farmer is controlled by the arrow keys / WASD, the up and down key is forward and backwards, while the left and right keys rotate the farmer counter-clockwise and clockwise.
To open and close the fenced of areas, click on a fence with the mouse, this will make the fence go down, and after 4 seconds it will go up again if there is not sheep or farmer on top of the fence. 
To control the sheep, you must take advantage of the fact that the sheep try to flock together, and the sheep try to keep a distance to the farmer. This can be used to “push” the sheep slowly forward.
Camera control: we have two cameras one from the top down, and one from the perspective of the farmer. You can switch between the cameras with the space button and zoom in / out with the scroll wheel of the mouse.
